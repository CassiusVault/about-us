                            <h5> Vault CEO, James Hammerton speaks at 2023 Investor Relations conference </h5>
                            <p>James was invited by the Investor relations society to be a panel member for a discussion on The rising role of media channels and other platforms for IRO’s, moderated by Bronwyn Nielsen. </p>

                            <p>The discussion brought to light that companies need to find new ways of displaying their financial data in order to reach day traders and retail investors who tend to be SENS averse and whose buy/sell behaviour can be influenced easily through Media articles weather factual or not. </p>


                                <p>The panelists all stressed the need for llisted companies to de-silo their comms, IR and executive teams to strategize  properly and minimise over reactive responses during crises. </p>


                                <p>It was also highlighted that there is no "one size fits all" approach that listeds should be using to communicate with their stakeholders and should instead use multiple overlapping platforms to cater for various segments of their audience .</p>

                            <p>Every minute of every day, Vault works to ensure your database is 100% accurate when you send out your messages.
<p>There are a number of ways in which this can happen.
<p>Members on Vault only have one profile, but are likely to belong to multiple company groups, so they will receive regular email alerts.
<p>In Vault, we monitor bounced emails twice a day with software and manual interventions, and you will be notified when a member in your group has been removed.
<p>It is possible for members to update their details, including their email address, as can the designated administrative investor relations executives.
